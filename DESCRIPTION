Title: Yeast-Proteome Secondary-Structure Calculator
Description: An extension for 'NetSurfP-2.0' which is specifically designed
    to analyze the results of bottom-up-proteomics that is primarily analyzed
    with 'MaxQuant'. This tool is designed to process a large number of yeast
    peptides that produced as a results of whole yeast cell-proteome digestion
    and provide a coherent picture of secondary structure of proteins.
